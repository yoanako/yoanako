	<h3>PROCESS</h3>
	<h5>The Data</h5>
	<p class="two-column-text">The European migrant crisis has been a hot topic since its start in 2015, and it has affected the Balkans and the countries surrounding the Mediterranean. For this project I wanted to explore the number of refugees that came to Bulgaria. I found a dataset that shows refugees and asylum seekers from 98 countries who came to Bulgaria between 1992 and 2017. </p>
</section>
<section class="process">
	<h5>Data Analysis</h5>
	<p class="two-column-text">
	This is the first time I work with country data and I found it very challenging. I discovered that there are many exceptions in the way countries and territories are classified so I did some research and found the Unites Nations classification:  <a href="https://www.un.org/depts/DGACM/RegionalGroups.shtml" target="_blank">United Nations Regional Groups of Member States</a> that helped me organize the data. 
	I created 6 different region groups, in which the countries fall according the United Nations Regional Groups of Member States as I immediately knew I would want to show the region of each country the refugees are coming from.</p>
	<div class="process-img">

	</div>
</section>
<section class="process">
	<p class="two-column-text">After I created the region groups and added them as a column to the dataset, I ran some basic statistical analysis and explored different ways to visualize the data. I first created a bar chart that showed the number of refugees per year in order to analyze the general trend. As expected, the numbers peak at 2015 with the onset of the migrant crisis.
	</p>
	<div class="process-img">
		<img src="../../images/projects/refugees_bg/ss_bar_value_per_year.png">
	</div>
</section>
<section class="process">
	<p class="two-column-text">I then created a stacked and grouped bar charts, showing the 4 types of refugees (Asylum-seekers, Refugees, Returned refugees, and Stateless persons) per year in order to analyze the type of migrants coming to Bulgaria.</p>
	<div class="process-img">
		<img src="../../images/projects/refugees_bg/ss_grouped_value_per_year.png">
		<img src="../../images/projects/refugees_bg/ss_stacked_value_per_year.png">
	</div>
</section>
<section class="process">
	<p class="two-column-text">
	I then wanted to look at the individual countries of origin and created a line chart. Unfortunately as we know some countries experiencing wars and severe conflict such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iran have seen the number of refugees greatly spike, which is clearly seen in the visualization. Their numbers are so much higher that the reminder of the countries are invisible.
	</p>
	<div class="process-img">
		<img src="../../images/projects/refugees_bg/ss_ref_line.png">
	</div>
</section>
<section class="process">
	<p class="two-column-text">
	I still thought that the country of origin is very important so I did some research and discovered that I can represent the data in individual graphs. This resulted in the final visualization where I ordered the countries from most to least migrants, color coded them by region, and showed how the numbers changed over time in an individual line graph. Finally, I discovered that there are some countries that have migrants only in a single year and I could not show them on the graphs so I made a table at the bottom. <br><br> This visualization was very difficult to create but I was very happy with the final result and learned a lot from doing it. 
	</p>
</section>

<section class="process">
	<h3>What is next?</h3>
	<p class="two-column-text">
	Once I become more confident with programming I would like to add an additional visualization - a map that shows the flow of migrants from the countries of origins to the destinations. I would also like to include many more countries apart from Bulgaria and look at how many refugees each host country has agreed to accept.
